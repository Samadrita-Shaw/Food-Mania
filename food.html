        <h4>Vegetables</h4>
      Vegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans or other
      animals as food. The original meaning is still commonly used and is
      applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter,
      including the flowers, fruits, stems, leaves, roots, and seeds. An
      alternate definition of the term is applied somewhat arbitrarily, often by
      culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude foods derived from some
      plants that are fruits, flowers, nuts, and cereal grains, but include
      savoury fruits such as tomatoes and courgettes, flowers such as broccoli,
      and seeds such as pulses. Originally, vegetables were collected from the
      wild by hunter-gatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the
      world, probably during the period 10,000 BC to 7,000 BC, when a new
      agricultural way of life developed. At first, plants which grew locally
      would have been cultivated, but as time went on, trade brought exotic
      crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types. Nowadays, most vegetables
      are grown all over the world as climate permits, and crops may be
      cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations.

        <h4>Fruits</h4>
       Fruits are the means by which flowering plants (also known as angiosperms) disseminate their seeds. 
       Edible fruits in particular have long propagated using the movements of humans and animals 
       in a symbiotic relationship that is the means for seed dispersal for the one group and nutrition for the other; in fact, 
       humans and many animals have become dependent on fruits as a source of food.[1] Consequently, fruits account 
       for a substantial fraction of the world's agricultural output, 
       and some (such as the apple and the pomegranate) have acquired extensive cultural and symbolic meanings.
       In common language usage, "fruit" normally means the seed-associated fleshy structures (or produce) of plants 
       that typically are sweet or sour and edible in the raw state, such as apples, bananas, grapes, lemons, oranges, 
       and strawberries. In botanical usage, the term "fruit" also includes many structures that are not commonly called 
       "fruits", such as nuts, bean pods, corn kernels, tomatoes, and wheat grains.
