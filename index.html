      Food lovers are people who simply love food. “Food lover” is an
      all-encompassing term that includes food enthusiasts of all types, no
      matter what drives their interests. Comedian Jim Gaffigan has made it
      clear that he is a food lover, but not a foodie: “[I'm] somebody who wants
      the closest best burger. I admire and I'm jealous of some foodies'
      culinary escapades but I've got five kids and I do stand-up every night,
      so I'm not somebody that can go out to dinner and go on these foodie
      adventures. I mean, I would like to, but I don't even get to go out to
      dinner as much as I'd like.” Do you love to eat food? You're a food lover.
      It's as simple as that. Thus, a foodie is a type of food lover, but a food
      lover may not necessarily be a foodie. This can be seen in the same way
      that a basketball player is a type of athlete, but an athlete may not
      necessarily be a basketball player. So, if you're a self-proclaimed
      foodie, it's completely accurate if you call yourself a food lover as
      well. Food lovers come from all different backgrounds and cultures—and
      come in all shapes and sizes. It may be surprising to know that even some
      of the world's fittest individuals consider themselves food lovers.
